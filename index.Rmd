### Description {data-width=400}

This dashboard visualizes the location and magnitude of all the earthquakes that occurred in the past week. The data is sourced from the USGS, which provides real-time GeoJSON feeds of seismic events around the world.

### Number of Earthquakes {data-width=200}

```{r}
earthquake_count <- nrow(earthquake[earthquake$type == "earthquake",])
valueBox(earthquake_count, icon = "fa-house-crack")
```

### Number of Explosions {data-width=200}

```{r}
explosion_count <- nrow(earthquake[earthquake$type == "explosion",])
valueBox(explosion_count, icon = "fa-explosion")
```

### Number of Quarry Blasts {data-width=200}

```{r}
quarry_blast_count <- nrow(earthquake[earthquake$type == "quarry blast",])
valueBox(quarry_blast_count, icon = "fa-hill-rockslide")
```
