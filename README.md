# Earthquake Dashboard: All Earthquakes in Past 7 Days

This dashboard is built using the flexdashboard package in r. This dashboard visualizes the location and magnitude of all the earthquakes that occurred in the past week. The data is sourced from the USGS, which provides real-time GeoJSON feeds of seismic events around the world. The dashboard is static but updated once a day through Github Action.
